# 🚗 Car Dataset - Data Visualization Project
This project explores a Large Cars Dataset using Python data visualization tools. The goal is to understand the distribution, relationships, and trends of various car features such as mileage, engine size, weight, and brand information.

📁 Dataset
The dataset, Large Cars Dataset.csv, includes various features like:

• Brand

• Model

• Engine size

• Horsepower

• Weight

• Acceleration

• Mileage

• And other relevant specifications

🔧 Technologies Used
• Python

• Pandas

• NumPy

• Matplotlib

• Seaborn

• WordCloud

📊 Process Overview
1. Loading the Dataset
• The dataset is loaded using pandas with proper encoding and delimiter configuration.

• Basic structure, column names, head/tail, and info are printed.

2. Initial Exploration
• .describe().T.plot(kind='bar') is used for a summarized statistical overview.

• Checks for:

• Missing values

• Duplicates

• Column data types

3. Distribution Analysis
• Histograms with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) are plotted for all numerical columns to visualize distribution trends.

4. Correlation Matrix
• A heatmap is generated using Seaborn to visualize correlation between all numerical features.

• Helps identify strong linear relationships between variables.

5. Categorical Features
• Count plots are generated for all categorical columns (object type) to visualize the frequency of different classes (e.g., Brands).

6. Word Cloud Generation
• A WordCloud is created based on the Brand column to visualize brand frequency in an engaging way.

• Uses STOPWORDS to remove irrelevant words and focuses on meaningful terms.

📌 Key Insights
• Distribution and skewness of numerical features are clearly observed.

• Heatmaps reveal potential multicollinearity.

• Brand dominance is visually highlighted using WordCloud.

• Useful for further feature engineering, clustering, or predictive modeling.

▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository.

2. Place the Large Cars Dataset.csv in the root directory.

3. Run code.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension.

📎 Output Samples
• 📈 Distribution plots

• 📊 Correlation heatmap

• 📦 Countplots for categorical variables

• ☁️ WordCloud for car brands

🧪 Future Scope
• Add outlier detection using boxplots.

• Feature engineering for predictive modeling.

• Clustering car types using k-means or hierarchical clustering.
